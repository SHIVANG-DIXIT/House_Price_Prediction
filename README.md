# House_Price_Prediction
House Price Prediction using Machine Learning. This project applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and Linear Regression to predict house prices based on features like bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and year built. The model is trained and evaluated with error metrics (MAE, RMSE, RÂ² Score) using Python and Scikit-learn.
