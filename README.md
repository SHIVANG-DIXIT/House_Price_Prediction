#  House Price Prediction

This project predicts the **price of houses** based on features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, and year built.  
It uses **Linear Regression** as the predictive model after performing **data cleaning, outlier removal, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.

##  Features of the Project
- Data Cleaning:
  - Removed irrelevant columns (`date`, `street`, `city`, `statezip`, `country`)
  - Outlier detection & removal using **IQR method**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Boxplots, histograms, correlation heatmaps
- Model Training:
  - Implemented **Linear Regression** with Scikit-learn
- Model Evaluation:
  - RÂ² Score
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
